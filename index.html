    <h2>My Brother</h2>
   <center> <img src="img.jpg" ></center>
   <P class="about">My brother Hitesh, 4 years older than me is undoubtedly the best brother in the world. He helps me with anything and everything . Talking about his nature, he is an introvert and an innocent person who stays quiet till a question is asked from the other side. Being in the same school we used to go via autorickshaw till 5th standard and whenever I could face any problem he was always there to lift me up in situations without any complaint. According to me being an elder sibling is such a difficult task where you always have to help a little one with their work. As children, we used to fight a lot but after the 10th he moved to another city and that is when I realized his importance when he wasn't there to fight with me and spend time with me and solve my foolish problems. He was always good in academics this was one more benefit of being a younger sibling for me.
    He is my best friend with whom I can laugh, cry and fight for my whole life. Thanks for always being there Bro!!!</P>
